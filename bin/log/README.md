## log file format

Each log file (e.g., event.log, app\_event.log) has the following formats.

[app\_id] [event\_id], [event\_name], [trigger\_time], [detection\_time], [diff]

The event.log and app\_event.log file records the event activities in the component-level and application-level, respectively.
