1) Handle exceptions on control channel (RST, etc.)
2) Buffer control channel messages in case of partial send
3) init raw_sock 

Modules to write for paper:
----------------------------
1)  test how many packet_in's per second a switch can handle
	for i = 1,2,4,...2000 packets per second :: regulated + unregulated
		see what fraction get through
2)  test to meassure throughput
	- tcp friendly
	- tcp unfriendly

Modules to write after paper:
-----------------------------
1) time from packet sent to packet_in recv'd
	for i=1,2,4... regulated and unregulated
2) time from flow_mod sent to buffer'd packet released
	for i=1,2,4... regulated and unregulated
3) same as #2, but with packet_out
